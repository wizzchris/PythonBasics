# Ints, long, float, complex

# These are numerical types which can use numerical operators

# Complex are built with imaginary numbers an example is if you need to track 2 separate currencies and you want to track is as one value

# Long are just integers of unlimited numbers
# ints are integers which are whole numbers
# Floats are floats and have decimal points

my_int = 10
my_float = 10.00
my_string = '10'

# operators  include add subtract divide multiply and modulus

num1 = 12
num2 = 21

print (num1 + num2)
# Adds two numbers
print (num1 - num2)
# Subtracts 2 numbers
print (num1 / num2)
# divides 2 numbers
print(num1 * num2)
# Multiplies two numbers
print (num1 % num2)
# Returns the remainder of the number

# // removes the decimals at the end

# Comparison operators  ---> operators

# == allows you to compare the operators / equating the values
# > greater than
# < less the
# <= less than or equals to
# >= greater than or equals to
# != not equal to

# print(something, something else ) this adds the two things and adds a space

# Booleans are either true or false
# Binary true or false - It is its own data type, It is useful when equating things
# None is the absence of anything its type is none

# We can also have logical, these are and and or and requires both things to be true to be true overall whereas or only requires one to be true
# (assertion a and assertion b ) ---> bool
# Or only requires one side to be true
