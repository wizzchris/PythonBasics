# These are unchangeable lists
# These are immutable
my_tuple = (2, 'hello', 22)
# A tuple is defined with a curved brackets. You can accuses the same commands with index and so. However you can not change the tuple.

# If you add two indexes its gives the index of the item ie
my_tuple[1][0]  # will give a h from the hello as itâ€™s the first letter
