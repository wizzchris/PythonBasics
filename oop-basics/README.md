# READ ME FILE for OOP

## Topics we will cover
- 4Pillers: Including
 . Abstraction
 . Inheritance
 . Polymorphism
 . Encapsulation 
 
- Git and github
- Documentation and Markdown Files 
- Best pracitices and organisation
 
 ## Definitions
 - Class - A class is a blue print for objects. Inside we define how objects characteristics and behaviors it can do. With classes you cna create instances of that class.
 - Instance - The occurrence of an object of a specific class 
 - Method - Is like a function that can only run inside a class
 - __init__ method - Is a method to inisilise the class. It runs everytime you creat an object using a class. AKA: it is known as the constructore method 
 - Behaviours - Methods which are like functions that belong to a class will be called on objects on that class 
 - Self refers to the instance. In a method, self is the specific instance of that
 - Pillars:
  - Abstraction
  . This is hidding complexity, and give our user only what they need to make things work.
  . Think of it like a black box
  . Example is shifting gears in a car
  . In code the methods .split() or .append() for strings and lists are abstracted. We only see the documentation
 - Attributes - They are variables or constants that are attached to a object
 - Class Attributes - Are attached to the class and are specific to every instance of that class
 - Inheritance - Ability to inherit all the behavior and characteristics of parent class
